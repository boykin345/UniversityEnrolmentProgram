*Set of User Stories*
(By Mikhail)

1. As a user, I want to be able to connect my bank account to the app so that I can view my account information and transaction history.
2. As a user, I want to be able to view my spending totals by category (e.g. car, clothing) so that I can better understand my overall spending patterns.
3. As a user, I want to be able to set average or usual costs for variable expenses (e.g. phone bill) so that I can better plan my monthly budget.
4. As a user, I want to be able to change the default category for a transaction from a pre-recognized shop so that I can accurately categorize my spending.
5. As a multi-account user, I want to be able to view a summary of my spending and budget across all accounts so that I can get a holistic view of my finances.
6. As a user, I want to be able to set reminders for upcoming bills and expenses so that I don't accidentally overspend and miss payments.
7. As a user, I want to be able to view how much money I have left each month for fun and casual spending so that I can avoid overspending and ensure I have enough for necessary expenses.

So, set of user stories more look like requirements and describe what exactly users want out of this app. Those stories could help to identify what gaps could be missed and what needs more attention. The main questions here is this app going to be delevoped for smartphones or PCs or both at the same time. Overall, user stories are a useful tool for ensuring that the app is designed with the user in mind and that it meets their needs and expectations.

If this app is gonna be implemented, it will require different permissions from the bank and users at the same time. Also, it needs to have secure encryptment system to provide safety for users. The app will enable users to see totals for different categories and types of expenses, such as fixed or unpredictable expenses. Besides, app will allow users to track their monthly bills and set an average or usual cost for variable bills.

Possible Questions:
- How app will provide security of users' data?
- How app gonna notify users about upcoming payments?
- Will app require to enter into it for each bank account they want to link?
