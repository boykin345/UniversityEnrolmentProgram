**University Module Enrolement Software**

With the University's requset for a module enrolement software, our team created two diagrams to plan the process. As the brief is quite complicated, our model allows us to clearly see the steps to produce this program. We chose to create both diagrams to see which better represents our project.

[Activity Diagram](https://projects.cs.nott.ac.uk/comp1003-2223-teams/team_59/coursework/-/blob/main/assets/2023-02-21_17.28.58.jpg)

The Activity Diagram provides a clear insight into the processes are going on inside the university as the flow of this diagram only has one route. Because of this, the diagram is less cluttered and acurately depicts the process for a student.

[Sequence Diagram](https://projects.cs.nott.ac.uk/comp1003-2223-teams/team_59/coursework/-/blob/main/assets/MicrosoftTeams-image__1_.png)

The Sequence Diagram on the other hand is slightly more complicated. The connections between the student and other stake holders spans the entire page. However, Whilst this makes the software creation slightly more tedious, the extra connections show how everything is reliant on one another. 

Furthermore, whilst the Activity Diagram represents the software well, the Sequence Diagram gives an extra insight which would be more useful in the development of this program.
